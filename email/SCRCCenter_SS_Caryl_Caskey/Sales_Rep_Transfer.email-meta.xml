Hello!

I’m your new Sales Specialist. You have my assurance that you’ll continue to receive the same great service you’ve always received from Univar. 

Allison has filled me in on your company’s operations. I have many years of sales experience serving customers in the South Central area. I am excited in this new role and am looking forward to servicing your chemical needs. Please be ensured that I am here to assist you with your chemical requirements.

In the coming weeks, I’d like to speak with you for a few minutes to learn more about your business and the ways Univar and I can assist you.

In the meantime, please contact me if there’s anything I can do for you. My number one priority is to help your business grow. Your success is my success.
 
Sincerely,
