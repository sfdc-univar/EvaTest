Good afternoon!

Just a heads up that I will be attending the Univar National Sales Meeting next week, and unavailable during this time.

With this in mind, I ask that you submit your orders in advance so that I can assist you this week.

Please let me know what I can do for you today, so that next week is a productive one for you and your team.


Thank you for being my customer!
