    <textOnly>Hi {First Name},

Shortly approaching is Society of Cosmetic Chemists California Chapter Suppliers’ day at the Long Beach Convention Center on Sept 24th and 25th.
I wanted to both invite you to attend, and request that you visit me and many other Univar experts at Booth 215.

This will be the first opportunity for you to meet me in person, and I am excited for the opportunity to learn more about you and your company. If you or one of your associates is planning on making it out for either day, I would love to know in advance so that I can make sure to specially plan to meet you.

Additionally, we will have tables at our booth that we can reserve to enable you a more personalized conversation, where we can include Univar industry experts. If you would like to schedule a face-to-face of this nature, let me know, and I work with you to schedule a time that works for all.

I look forward to hearing back from you, and hope for the opportunity to enhance your experience when working with Univar.
