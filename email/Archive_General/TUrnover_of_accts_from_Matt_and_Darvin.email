I wanted to take a moment and introduce myself as your new sales rep here at Univar.  My name is Kent Brittle.  I have been a Sales Representative with Univar for 6 years.  I will be managing your account that was previously managed by Kathy Hamm.  I will be contacting you soon to discuss your chemical needs.  Prior to that time, if you need any assistance, please feel free to contact me at 214-503-5710 or by e-mail at Kent.Brittle@Univarusa.com. Please continue to call the Customer Service Team in Odessa office for all orders. 

 look forward to meeting you via phone and learning more about your company and how Univar can help you achieve your goals.
