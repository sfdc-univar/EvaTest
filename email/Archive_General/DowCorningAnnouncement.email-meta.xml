You may know that Univar is the largest chemical distributor in North America. We carry hundreds of products for every industry and market, including 

amines, surfactants, acids, hydrocarbons, inorganics and many more.




But did you know that Univar now carries Dow Corning anti-foams, defoamers and other silicone products? If you have a silicone need, we have a solution. 

 

 
To learn more, call me at {!User.MobilePhone}. Iâ€™ll be happy to answer any questions you have about our new line of Dow Corning silicones.
