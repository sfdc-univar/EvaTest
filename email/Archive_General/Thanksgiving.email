I wanted to take a minute and wish you and your company a safe and enjoyable holiday!  Univar is closed Thursday and Friday, but will be back up and running Monday morning.  Please plan accordingly, but feel free to email me should you need anything.  In the meantime, eat as much turkey as you can and have a great Thanksgiving!

Warmest Wishes,
