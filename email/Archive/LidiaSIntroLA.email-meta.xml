{!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for allowing me to introduce myself as your new Univar Sales Specialist. It was a pleasure speaking to you on the phone today. I&apos;ll be calling you again in the coming weeks to ensure that Univar is providing you with the products and services you require.

If you have any current need or requirement you would like to discuss please feel free to contact me at your leisure.


I look forward to working with you and making the process of acquiring industrial chemicals and ingredients as easy and cost-efficient as possible. Univar and I can show you how.
