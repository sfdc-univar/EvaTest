{!Contact.FirstName},

It was a pleasure speaking to you on the phone today. I&apos;ll be calling you again in the coming weeks to learn more about your business and the ways Univar and I can help you.

Attached to this email, you’ll find for your reference a Univar product brochure in PDF format. 


In the meantime, please contact me if there’s anything I can do for you. My number one priority is to help your business grow.
