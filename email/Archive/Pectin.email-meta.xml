It was a pleasure speaking with you on the phone today. I&apos;ll be calling again in the coming weeks to assist you in finding the right hydrocolloid for your product.

The texture of your product is one of the key components to customer satisfaction. Univar has a great selection of hydrocolloids that can make your product a success in the marketplace. I have included literature with this email, if you have any questions about the information I&apos;ve provided, feel free to ask me. My contact information is on the right.


I look forward to helping you make the process of creating the right texture for your product easy and cost-efficient. Univar and I can show you how.
