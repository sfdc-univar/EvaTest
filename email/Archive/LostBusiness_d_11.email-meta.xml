{!Contact.FirstName},

At Univar, we value each and every one of our customers. It’s been a while since you’ve placed an order with us, and I’d like the opportunity to serve your company again.


As a Univar customer, you can always expect to receive unparalleled customer service, and the highest quality products the industry has to offer—delivered when you need them, and at a competitive price. As a Sales Specialist representing Univar, my goal is to show you how Univar can help make the process of acquiring your raw materials simple and cost-efficient, and to win you back as one of our valued customers. 


I’d like the opportunity to discuss how Univar can meet your facility’s needs. I will be contacting you shortly, however if there’s anything I can do for you, please don’t hesitate to call me.
