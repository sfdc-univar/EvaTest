{!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for being my customer.

To my existing customers, I&apos;m honored to have the opportunity to serve you. To my new customers, I’m pleased to introduce myself as your new Univar Sales Specialist. I look forward to providing all of you the continued great service you’ve always received from Univar. 


Over the next months, I plan to speak with you for a few minutes to learn more about your business and the ways Univar and I can assist you. 


In the meantime, please contact me if there’s anything I can do for you. My number one priority is to help your business grow. Your success is my success.
