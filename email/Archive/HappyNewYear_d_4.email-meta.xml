On behalf of everyone at Univar, I hope 2006 was a prosperous year for you, your family and friends. With every new year, there are opportunities and challenges for each of us. I hope that whatever the coming year brings, I can continue to help you with your chemical and ingredient needs, simplifying the process of ordering, delivery and storage for you. 


I look forward to all the new opportunities and challenges that this new year will bring, and to our continued, successful working relationship in 2007. 


Happy New Year!!






Sincerely,
