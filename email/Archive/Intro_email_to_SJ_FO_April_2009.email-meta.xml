    <subject>Congratulations to Peko!   Introducing Kraig Solomon, Univar USA</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,
 
I want to share some exciting news with you:  Peko Haidari has been promoted to Univar Customer Service Supervisor in San Jose!     Please join me in congratulating Peko on this well-deserved  promotion within Univar USA.
 
As such, I have the privilege of introducing myself as your new Univar Sales Representative.   My name is Kraig Solomon, and just like Peko, I am only a phone call or email away Monday-Friday.   
 
I will be calling you in the coming days/weeks to ensure that you continue to receive the A+ service you have experienced from Peko and Univar.
I am looking forward to working with you.    If you have an immediate need, please contact me anytime. 
 
 
Sincerely,

Kraig Solomon 
Univar Sales Representative
